# AutoImage

## Project for university

This code will need to be run on Python (3.7). Python can be installed from here https://www.python.org/downloads/ or by running the following command on Mac.

```brew install python```

This code will be run using pipenv so you may need to install pip as well which can be done by the following command on Mac.

```brew install pip```

Once you have cloned the repository on your own machine, you will need to install all of the libraries and dependencies which are in the Pipfile.lock.

To install the packages do the following command.

```pipenv install --ignore-pipfile```

To run the file, do the following.

```
pipenv shell
cd AutoImage
python predict.py
```
